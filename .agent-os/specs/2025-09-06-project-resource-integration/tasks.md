2. GET /api/employees/:id/assignments - Multi-project employee view
3. PUT /api/assignments/:id - Update assignment allocation
4. DELETE /api/assignments/:id - Remove assignment
5. GET /api/assignments/conflicts - Real-time conflict detection

Business Logic:
- Capacity validation (prevent >100% allocation)
- Skills matching verification
- Date range consistency checking
- Conflict detection and warnings
```

### **âš¡ Phase 1C - Essential Frontend Components**

```

#### Basic Assignment Interface
```typescript
// Task 1.6: Assignment Management UI (4-5 days)  
Priority: HIGH
Assignee: Frontend Developer

Components to create:
1. EmployeeAssignmentsDashboard - Multi-project employee view
2. AssignmentCard - Individual assignment summary
3. QuickAssignmentForm - Simple assignment creation
4. CapacityIndicator - Visual capacity and utilization display
5. ConflictWarning - Alert component for over-allocation
