- Branches: 26.23% (745/2,840)
- Functions: 28.84% (634/2,199)
- Lines: 30.02% (2,132/7,103)
```

#### Low Coverage Areas:
- Database layer: 14.09%

- Controllers: 45.08%

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Service Startup Problems
- **Impact:** All API integration tests failing with 503 errors
- **Likely Cause:** Database connection or service initialization issues
- **Priority:** HIGH

### 2. Type Definition Mismatches
- **Impact:** Multiple test compilation failures
- **Examples:**
  - Socket.io import issues
  - Jest mock type problems
  - Property access errors
- **Priority:** HIGH

### 3. Test Data/Fixture Issues
- **Impact:** Missing test data files
- **Examples:** `shared-test-data.json` not found
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### 4. Mock Configuration Problems
- **Impact:** Unit tests failing due to mock setup issues
- **Examples:**
  - `getAvailableEmployees` vs `getAllEmployees` method name mismatches
  - Mock query chaining issues
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

## Mock Usage Assessment

### Issues Found:
- **Type Mismatches:** Mock methods not matching actual service interfaces
- **Chaining Problems:** `mockResolvedValueOnce` chaining failures
- **Method Names:** Service method name mismatches in mocks

### No Critical Warnings:
- No deprecated mock usage detected
- No memory leak warnings from mocks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1):
1. **Fix Service Startup Issues**
   - Investigate 503 errors in integration tests
   - Verify database connection in test environment
   - Check service initialization order

2. **Resolve Type Definition Issues**
   - Fix Socket.io import syntax
   - Update Jest mock types
   - Align mock interfaces with actual services

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2):
3. **Create Missing Test Fixtures**
   - Add `shared-test-data.json`
   - Organize test data properly

4. **Fix Unit Test Mocks**
   - Align mock method names with services
   - Fix mock chaining issues
   - Update test expectations

### Long-term Improvements (Priority 3):
5. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Target 80%+ coverage across all layers
   - Add missing integration tests
   - Enhance security test coverage

6. **Standardize Test Structure**
   - Consistent test organization
   - Shared test utilities
   - Better test data management

## Conclusion

**The NotificationService timer issues have been successfully resolved**, but the test suite has significant infrastructure and configuration problems that prevent most tests from running successfully.

**Current State:**
- Timer cleanup: ✅ FIXED
- Integration tests: ❌ FAILING (service startup issues)
- Security tests: ❌ FAILING (authentication/authorization)
- Unit tests: ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING (mock configuration issues)
- Performance tests: ⚠️ MIXED (concurrency works, realtime fails)

**Next Steps:**
The development team should focus on fixing the service startup and type definition issues before proceeding with feature development. The test infrastructure needs significant attention to provide reliable feedback on code quality.

**Recommendation:** Address the critical service startup issues first, as they are blocking the majority of meaningful test execution.
