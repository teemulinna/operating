> Spec: Resource Planning Dashboard
> Created: 2025-09-05
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform the existing Employee Management System into a comprehensive resource planning dashboard that enables project managers to efficiently allocate team members based on capacity, skills, and availability across multiple projects.

## User Stories

### Resource Capacity Planning
As a project manager, I want to view weekly capacity for all team members, so that I can effectively plan resource allocation across multiple projects.

The manager can view a calendar-style interface showing each employee's weekly availability, current project commitments, and remaining capacity. They can filter by department, role, or specific date ranges to identify available resources for upcoming project phases.

### Skills-Based Resource Matching
As a project manager, I want to filter employees by specific skills and competency levels, so that I can assign the right people to tasks that match their expertise.

The system provides advanced filtering options where managers can search for employees by technical skills, certifications, experience levels, and project history. Each employee profile displays their skill ratings and recent project contributions to aid in selection decisions.

### Real-Time Availability Dashboard
As a project manager, I want to see real-time availability status and capacity utilization for my team, so that I can make informed decisions about project timelines and resource needs.

A comprehensive dashboard displays current availability status (available, busy, on leave), capacity utilization percentages, and upcoming schedule conflicts. Visual indicators help quickly identify over-allocated or under-utilized resources.

### Team Capacity Overview
As a department head, I want to view aggregate team capacity and utilization rates, so that I can balance workloads and identify staffing gaps.

The interface provides team-level metrics including total capacity, current utilization rates, upcoming availability, and trend analysis. Managers can drill down from team view to individual employee details and identify patterns in resource allocation.

### Project Planning Export
As a project manager, I want to export resource allocation data, so that I can integrate capacity planning with external project management tools.

The system allows exporting of resource assignments, capacity data, and availability schedules in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, JSON) for integration with tools like Microsoft Project, Jira, or custom project planning systems.

## Spec Scope

1. **Weekly Capacity Interface** - Calendar-based view showing employee availability and project commitments by week
2. **Skills-Based Filtering** - Advanced search and filter functionality based on employee competencies and experience
3. **Availability Dashboard** - Real-time status indicators and capacity utilization visualization
4. **Resource Allocation Tools** - Drag-and-drop interface for assigning employees to projects and time periods
5. **Team Capacity Analytics** - Aggregate views and utilization metrics at team and department levels
6. **Export Functionality** - Multiple export formats for integration with external project planning tools

## Out of Scope

- Project creation and management features (focus is on resource allocation)
- Time tracking and timesheets (allocation planning only, not actual time recording)
- Financial budgeting and cost calculations
- Performance evaluation and employee review systems
- HR onboarding and employee lifecycle management

## Expected Deliverable

1. Interactive resource planning dashboard with calendar-based capacity views
2. Advanced filtering system supporting skills, availability, and competency searches
3. Real-time availability status indicators and utilization metrics
4. Drag-and-drop resource allocation interface for project assignments
5. Team-level capacity overview with aggregate utilization reporting
6. Export functionality supporting CSV, Excel, and JSON formats
7. Responsive design supporting both desktop and tablet usage for mobile project management
