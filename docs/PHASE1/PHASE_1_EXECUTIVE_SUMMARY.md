## 📋 Decision Points

### Immediate Decisions Needed
1. **Visualization Library:** D3.js vs Recharts vs Custom
2. **Caching Strategy:** Redis vs React Query only
3. **Deployment:** Staged rollout vs Big bang

### Recommended Choices
1. ✅ **Recharts** - Simpler than D3, good enough for heat maps
2. ✅ **React Query only** - Start simple, add Redis later
3. ✅ **Staged rollout** - Heat maps first, gather feedback
