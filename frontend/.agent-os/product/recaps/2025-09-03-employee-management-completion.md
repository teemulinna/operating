- **Environment configuration** for different deployment stages
- **Health monitoring** with Prometheus metrics
- **Security configurations** and best practices

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **React Query** for server state management
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **Radix UI** for accessible component primitives

### Backend Stack
- **Node.js with Express** for API server
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence
- **Zod** for runtime validation
- **CORS** and security middleware

### Testing Strategy
- **Vitest** for unit testing with React Testing Library
- **Playwright** for integration and e2e testing
- **Coverage reporting** with thresholds for quality gates
- **Mock data** and fixtures for consistent testing

## Performance Metrics

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript coverage**: 100% of application code
- **Test coverage**: Targeting 80%+ across all modules
- **ESLint compliance**: Zero warnings in production build
- **Bundle optimization**: Code splitting and lazy loading

### User Experience
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Loading states**: Skeleton loaders and progress indicators
- **Error handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance

## Deployment Ready Features

### Infrastructure
- **Docker containerization** with multi-stage builds
- **Environment configuration** for dev/staging/production
- **Health check endpoints** for load balancer integration
- **Monitoring setup** with Prometheus metrics

### Security
- **Input validation** on all API endpoints
- **SQL injection protection** with parameterized queries
