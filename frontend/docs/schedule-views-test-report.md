## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Implement Summary Statistics Cards** (US-ES1.1-1.4)
   - Add `data-testid` attributes for stat cards
   - Display Total Employees, Active Projects, Over-allocated count, Average Utilization
   - Include utilization badges (High/Medium/Low)

2. **Implement Over-allocation Alerts** (US-ES2.1-2.4)
   - Create alert card component with `data-testid="over-allocation-alert"`
   - Show count of affected employees
   - Provide actionable guidance
   - Add visual alert icon

3. **Implement Utilization Legend** (US-ES3.1-3.4)
   - Add Schedule Management Tips card
   - Create Utilization Legend with color coding
   - Document utilization ranges

### Medium Priority
4. **Add Data Attributes for Testing**
   - Add `data-testid="employee-name"` to employee name elements
   - Add `data-testid="current-week"` to week display
   - Add `data-testid="weekly-capacity"` to capacity elements

5. **Implement "This Week" Button** (US-SV2.3)
   - Add button to return to current week quickly
   - Include in navigation controls

### Low Priority
6. **Enhance Test Assertions**
   - Add more specific checks for week change validation
   - Verify actual data changes, not just element presence

## Test File Location

The comprehensive test suite has been created at:
```
frontend/tests/e2e/specs/schedule-views.spec.ts
```

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all schedule views tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/schedule-views.spec.ts

# Run specific test group
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/schedule-views.spec.ts --grep "US-SV1"

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/schedule-views.spec.ts --ui

# Generate HTML report
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/schedule-views.spec.ts --reporter=html
```

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Missing Features**: Focus on US-ES1 (Statistics) and US-ES2 (Alerts)
2. **Add Data Attributes**: Ensure all interactive elements have proper `data-testid` attributes
3. **Run Tests in CI**: Integrate into continuous integration pipeline
4. **Monitor Coverage**: Track test coverage as features are implemented
5. **Update Tests**: Adjust tests as UI implementation evolves

## Conclusion

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of Schedule View functionality. The basic schedule grid and navigation features are working well. The Enhanced Schedule features (statistics, alerts, legends) need to be implemented to achieve full acceptance criteria compliance.

**Overall Progress**: 54% of acceptance criteria are fully implemented and passing tests. The remaining 46% need feature implementation.
