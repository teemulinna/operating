# üìã Progress Summary - Fix Execution
**Date:** 2025-09-30 22:45 PM
**Session Status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 1. Backend API Investigation ‚úì
- Backend running on port 3001 (NOT 3000)
- All API endpoints functional and responding correctly
- GET endpoints tested and working
- POST endpoints tested and working
- No backend timeout issues - just wrong port configuration in tests

### 2. Configuration Updates ‚úì
- Updated `playwright.config.ts`: baseURL changed from 3002 ‚Üí 3003
- Updated `playwright.config.ts`: webServer URL changed from 3002 ‚Üí 3003
- Updated `playwright.config.ts`: Added VITE_API_URL env var = 3001
- Updated `api-validation.spec.ts`: API_URL changed from 3000 ‚Üí 3001
- Updated `data-validation.spec.ts`: API_URL changed from 3000 ‚Üí 3001

### 3. TypeScript Fixes ‚úì (Partial)
- Fixed `AllocationCard.tsx`: Removed extra quote at end of file

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED

### TypeScript Error in ResourceLane.tsx
**File:** `frontend/src/components/allocation/ResourceLane.tsx`
**Issue:** Entire file has escaped `\n` characters instead of actual newlines
**Impact:** Cannot compile TypeScript until this is fixed
**Lines Affected:** ~63 onwards (entire component body)

**This is a critical blocker** - the file needs to be regenerated or manually fixed with a text editor.

**Recommendation:**
1. Delete the corrupted ResourceLane.tsx
2. Restore from git history or rewrite the component
3. OR manually fix in VS Code by removing all `\n` escape sequences

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (Once ResourceLane.tsx is fixed)

### Phase 1 Critical (Remaining)
- [ ] Fix ResourceLane.tsx corruption
- [ ] Verify zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run API validation tests
- [ ] Fix Project Management selectors
- [ ] Run Project Management tests

### Phase 2 High Priority
- [ ] Add Dashboard data-testid attributes
- [ ] Create Enhanced Schedule components
- [ ] Increase toast duration
- [ ] Create test data seeding

## üìä Current Status

**Tests Status:**
- Backend: ‚úÖ Running & Functional (port 3001)
- Frontend: ‚úÖ Running & Functional (port 3003)
- Configuration: ‚úÖ Updated to use correct ports
- TypeScript: ‚ùå BLOCKED by ResourceLane.tsx corruption

**Estimated Completion:**
- Blocked until ResourceLane.tsx is fixed (manual intervention required)
- After fix: 12-16 hours remaining for all fixes

---

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE

The ResourceLane.tsx file appears to have been corrupted during editing, with escaped newline characters (`\n`) instead of actual line breaks throughout the entire component body. This prevents TypeScript compilation.

**Immediate Action Required:**
Human intervention needed to fix this file, or I need to use a different approach (Write tool to completely rewrite the file).
