**TypeScript Data Models:**
```typescript
interface Employee {
  id: string;
  personalInfo: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    email: string;
    phone?: string;
  };
  employment: {
    employeeId: string;
    department: string;
    role: string;
    startDate: Date;
    status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'on-leave';
  };
  capacity: {
    weeklyHours: number;

  yearsOfExperience?: number;
}

interface SearchFilters {
  department?: string[];

- Email format validation and uniqueness checking
- Capacity hours validation (0-80 hours per week)
- Skill selection with autocomplete and validation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

**Responsive Design (TailwindCSS):**
- Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px)
- Adaptive grid layouts for employee cards (1-4 columns based on screen size)
- Collapsible sidebar for filters on mobile
- Touch-friendly interface elements with minimum 44px touch targets
- Optimized table views with horizontal scrolling on mobile

**API Integration:**
- RESTful API client with TypeScript interfaces
- Error handling with retry logic and user notifications
- Loading states for all async operations
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Real-time updates using Server-Sent Events or WebSocket connection
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed employee data

**Search and Filtering:**
- Debounced search input (300ms delay)
- Multi-select filters with checkbox groups
- Advanced search modal with complex query building
- Search result highlighting and relevance scoring
- Export filtered results to CSV format
- Search history and saved filter presets

**Accessibility Compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA):**
- Semantic HTML structure with proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility with descriptive alt text
- Color contrast ratios meeting AA standards (4.5:1 minimum)
- Focus indicators for all focusable elements
- Skip navigation links for keyboard users
- Error announcements for screen readers

### Backend Architecture (Node.js/Express with TypeScript)

**API Endpoints:**
- RESTful endpoints for employee CRUD operations
- Advanced search endpoint with query parameter support
- Bulk operations endpoints for import/export
- Capacity tracking endpoints with real-time updates
- Audit trail endpoints for change tracking

**Data Validation:**
- Input sanitization and validation using express-validator
- Business rule enforcement (unique email, valid capacity ranges)
- File upload validation for bulk import (CSV format, size limits)
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- JWT-based authentication (preparation for future implementation)
- Role-based middleware (HR Manager, Team Lead, Project Manager)
- API key validation for system integrations

### Database Design (PostgreSQL)

**Core Tables:**
- `employees` - Main employee data
- `skills` - Skill definitions and categories
- `employee_skills` - Many-to-many relationship with experience levels
- `capacity_history` - Audit trail for capacity changes
- `departments` - Department reference data

**Performance Optimization:**
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields (email, department, skills)
- Full-text search indexing for employee names and skills
- Connection pooling for optimal database performance
- Query optimization for complex search operations

## Approach

### Development Strategy

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)**
- Set up React 18+ project with TypeScript and Vite
- Configure TailwindCSS and Shadcn/ui component library
- Implement basic routing with React Router
- Set up Express.js backend with TypeScript
- Create PostgreSQL database schema and migrations
- Implement basic CRUD API endpoints

**Phase 2: Employee Management (Week 3-4)**
- Build employee form with validation using React Hook Form + Zod
- Implement employee directory with pagination
- Create employee profile view and edit functionality
- Add basic search and filtering capabilities
- Implement backend validation and error handling

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)**
- Build capacity management dashboard
- Implement advanced search with multiple filters
- Add bulk import/export functionality
- Create real-time capacity calculations
- Implement audit trail and change tracking

**Phase 4: Polish & Accessibility (Week 7-8)**
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Optimize performance and loading states
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement responsive design refinements
- Conduct accessibility testing and fixes

### State Management
- React Context for global app state (user session, theme)
- React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- Local component state for form handling
- URL state for search filters and pagination

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Accessibility testing with jest-axe

## External Dependencies

### Required New Dependencies
