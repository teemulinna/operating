## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY RISKS

### Risk 1: Performance Degradation with Large Datasets
**Risk Category:** Technical
**Probability:** 70% | **Impact:** High | **Risk Score:** 21/25

#### **Risk Description**
Heat maps with 100+ employees over 12+ months may cause:
- Page load times >5 seconds
- Browser memory exhaustion
- UI freezing during data processing
- Poor user experience leading to feature abandonment

#### **Mitigation Strategies**
```typescript
// Technical Mitigations
1. Data Virtualization Implementation
   - Virtual scrolling for large employee lists
   - Time-based data pagination
   - Progressive loading with skeleton screens
   - Client-side data caching with TTL

2. Server-Side Optimization
   - Database query optimization with proper indexes
   - Materialized views for pre-calculated aggregations
   - Redis caching for frequently accessed heat map data
   - API response compression and pagination

3. Frontend Performance
   - React.memo for expensive heat map components
   - useMemo for calculation-heavy operations
   - Web Workers for data processing
   - Canvas rendering for large grids instead of DOM

// Performance Monitoring
- Implement performance metrics collection
- Set up alerts for page load times >3 seconds
- Monitor memory usage and set limits
- User experience tracking for feature usage
```

#### **Rollback Plan**
```sql
-- Emergency Performance Rollback
-- 1. Disable heat map feature via feature flag
UPDATE feature_flags SET enabled = false WHERE feature_name = 'capacity_heat_maps';

-- 2. Revert to simple list view
-- 3. Reduce data query scope to 30 days maximum
-- 4. Implement emergency caching layer
```

#### **Success Metrics**
- Heat map load time: <2 seconds for 6-month view
- Memory usage: <500MB for largest datasets
- User satisfaction: >80% positive feedback on performance

   - Advanced options hidden by default
   - Step-by-step wizard for complex patterns
   - Clear visual feedback during setup

2. Validation and Guidance
   - Real-time pattern validation

   - Manual override capabilities
   - Simple "standard hours" as safe default
```

#### **Rollback Plan**
```sql
-- Pattern Feature Rollback
-- 1. Disable availability patterns via feature flag
UPDATE feature_flags SET enabled = false WHERE feature_name = 'availability_patterns';

-- 2. Revert to simple availability calculation
-- 3. Preserve pattern data but use legacy allocation logic

## 🛡️ COMPREHENSIVE ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Emergency Rollback (< 30 minutes)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency Feature Disable Script

# 1. Disable all new features via feature flags
psql -c "UPDATE feature_flags SET enabled = false WHERE feature_name IN ('heat_maps', 'availability_patterns', 'scenarios');"

# 2. Revert to previous frontend build
kubectl rollout undo deployment/frontend-app

# 3. Revert API endpoints
kubectl rollout undo deployment/backend-api

# 4. Clear Redis cache to force data refresh
redis-cli FLUSHALL

# 5. Notify users via system message
psql -c "INSERT INTO system_messages (message, type, active) VALUES ('System temporarily reverted to previous version. New features will return shortly.', 'warning', true);"
```

### Partial Feature Rollback (< 2 hours)
```sql
-- Selective Feature Disable
-- Option 1: Disable only problematic features
UPDATE feature_flags SET enabled = false WHERE feature_name = 'heat_maps';

-- Option 2: Reduce feature scope
UPDATE feature_flags SET config = '{"maxEmployees": 50, "maxMonths": 3}' WHERE feature_name = 'heat_maps';

-- Option 3: Enable safe mode
INSERT INTO feature_flags (feature_name, enabled, config) VALUES
('safe_mode', true, '{"disableComplexFeatures": true}');
```

### Data Recovery Rollback (< 4 hours)
```sql
-- Database Recovery Process
-- 1. Stop all write operations
-- 2. Restore from backup to recovery database
-- 3. Migrate critical data only
-- 4. Verify data integrity
-- 5. Switch to recovery database
-- 6. Resume operations
```

class RiskMonitor {
  async checkRisks() {
    const metrics = await this.collectMetrics();

    if (metrics.performanceScore < 70) {
      await this.enablePerformanceMode();
    }

    if (metrics.errorRate > 5) {
      await this.enableSafeMode();
    }

    if (metrics.userSatisfaction < 60) {
      await this.triggerUserExperienceReview();
    }
