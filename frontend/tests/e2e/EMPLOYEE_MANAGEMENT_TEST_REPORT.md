```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/employee-management.spec.ts
```

### Run Specific User Story:
```bash
# View Employee List
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/employee-management.spec.ts --grep "US-EM1"

# Add New Employee
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/employee-management.spec.ts --grep "US-EM2"

# Edit Employee
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/employee-management.spec.ts --grep "US-EM3"

npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/employee-management.spec.ts --grep "INT-"
```

### Run Single Test:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/employee-management.spec.ts --grep "EM1.1"
```

### Run with UI Mode:
```bash
npx playwright test --ui tests/e2e/specs/employee-management.spec.ts
```

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Backend Server:** Must be running on port 3001
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # from root directory
   ```

2. **Frontend Server:** Must be running on port 3002
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # from frontend directory
   ```

3. **Database:** PostgreSQL must be running with test data

---

## Test Data Requirements

The tests interact with real backend APIs and require:
- At least one department in the database
- No strict data requirements (tests create/cleanup own data)
- Backend must support full CRUD operations for employees

---

## Known Issues & Recommendations

### 1. Loading Skeleton Test (EM1.2)
**Issue:** Timing-dependent, may fail on very fast connections
**Recommendation:** Consider this test optional or adjust timeout strategy

### 2. Frontend Server Stability
**Issue:** Playwright webServer config should start frontend automatically but may have timing issues
**Recommendation:** Ensure frontend is manually started before running tests

### 3. Test Isolation
**Issue:** EM2.2 and EM4.3 create real data in database
**Recommendation:** Tests include cleanup, but consider using a dedicated test database

---

## Code Quality Metrics

### Test Structure:
- ✅ Follows Page Object Model pattern (can be enhanced)
- ✅ Uses test.describe for organization
- ✅ Uses test.step for detailed reporting
- ✅ Proper async/await handling
- ✅ Good timeout handling (10-15 seconds)
- ✅ Comprehensive data-testid usage

### Coverage:
- ✅ Happy path scenarios
- ✅ Validation scenarios
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Integration workflows
- ✅ User interaction patterns

---
