## Technical Implementation Strategy

### **Database Evolution**
```sql
-- Phase 1: Foundation
CREATE TABLE projects, project_roles, resource_assignments

-- Phase 2: Advanced planning
ADD resource_conflicts, optimization_suggestions

-- Phase 3: Analytics
CREATE time_entries, reporting_views

-- Phase 4: Scenarios
ADD scenarios, ai_models, integration_configs
```

### **API Architecture**
```typescript
// RESTful API with versioning
/api/v2/projects/*           // Project management
/api/v2/resources/*          // Resource planning
/api/v2/reports/*            // Analytics & reporting
/api/v2/integrations/*       // External tool APIs
```

### **Frontend Architecture**
```typescript
// Component-based React architecture
src/
  components/
    projects/        // Project management UI
    resources/       // Resource planning UI
    reports/         // Analytics dashboard
    shared/          // Reusable components
  hooks/
    useProjects/     // Project management hooks
    useResources/    // Resource planning hooks
    useReports/      // Reporting hooks
```

## Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
1. **Database Performance**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization
2. **Complex Queries**: Use materialized views for reporting
3. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket for live updates
4. **Data Consistency**: Use database transactions and constraints

### **Business Risks**
1. **User Adoption**: Incremental rollout with training
2. **Data Migration**: Comprehensive backup and rollback procedures
3. **Integration Issues**: Thorough testing with external APIs
4. **Performance**: Load testing with realistic data volumes
