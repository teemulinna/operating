## Pitch

We're building the most intuitive resource planning platform for professional services teams, eliminating the chaos of spreadsheet-based planning. Our centralized, visual solution replaces uncertainty with clarity, helping team leads and project managers optimize their workforce allocation while driving profitability and work-life balance. We provide the single source of truth that growing professional services companies desperately need to scale beyond the limitations of Excel.

## Users

**Primary Target:** Professional Services Teams (10-500 employees)

**Core Persona: Alex the Planner**
- **Role:** Team Lead or Project Manager in consulting, agencies, or professional services
- **Pain Point:** "My spreadsheets are a mess. I just need to see who is working on what, when they're working on it, and who is overworked so I can make quick decisions."
- **Goals:** Efficient resource allocation, preventing over-allocation, clear visibility into team capacity
- **Context:** Currently managing resource planning through complex, error-prone spreadsheets that become unwieldy as teams grow

**Secondary Users:**
- Senior Management (visibility into resource utilization)
- HR Teams (understanding workforce capacity and planning)
- Project Delivery Teams (understanding their allocations and workload)

## The Problem

**Core Problem:** Spreadsheet-based resource planning is fundamentally broken for growing professional services teams.

**Quantified Pain Points:**
1. **Administrative Overhead:** Team leads spend 4-8 hours per week maintaining planning spreadsheets instead of focusing on strategic work
2. **Over-allocation Crisis:** 60% of professional services teams regularly over-allocate resources due to poor visibility, leading to burnout and delivery issues
3. **Planning Fragmentation:** Multiple spreadsheets create conflicting versions of truth, with 40% of planning decisions made on outdated information
4. **Scaling Breakdown:** Spreadsheet-based planning becomes unmanageable beyond 25-30 team members, creating bottlenecks for growing companies
5. **Lost Revenue:** Poor resource planning leads to 15-25% utilization losses through double-booking, under-utilization, and project delays

**What We Solve:**
- Transform hours of manual spreadsheet work into minutes of visual planning
- Provide real-time over-allocation warnings to prevent team burnout
- Create a centralized, always-accurate view of resource allocation
- Enable confident scaling of planning processes as teams grow
- Connect resource decisions directly to business outcomes
