## Tasks

### 1. Database Service Singleton Architecture Fix

- [x] 1.1 Write tests for database service singleton pattern and connection sharing
- [x] 1.2 Refactor database service to implement proper singleton pattern with shared connection pool
- [x] 1.3 Update database service to ensure single connection instance across application lifecycle
- [x] 1.4 Implement proper initialization sequence for database service in server startup
- [x] 1.5 Add connection health checks and reconnection logic for robustness
- [x] 1.6 Update all API route handlers to use the singleton database service instance
- [x] 1.7 Add proper error handling for database connection failures
- [x] 1.8 Verify all database service tests pass and connection sharing works correctly

### 2. Service Dependency Injection & API Integration

- [x] 2.1 Write tests for service dependency injection and API endpoint database connectivity
- [x] 2.2 Implement dependency injection container for database service across API routes
- [x] 2.3 Update all employee API endpoints to properly inject and use database service
- [x] 2.4 Refactor controller methods to receive database service as dependency
- [x] 2.5 Add service registration and resolution mechanism for clean architecture
- [x] 2.6 Update middleware to ensure database service availability for all requests

- [x] 2.8 Verify all API integration tests pass and endpoints return proper responses

### 3. System Validation & End-to-End Testing

- [x] 3.1 Write comprehensive end-to-end tests for complete system functionality
- [x] 3.2 Test all API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with real database connections
- [x] 3.3 Validate frontend-backend integration with proper data flow
- [x] 3.4 Test error scenarios and proper error handling across the full stack
- [x] 3.5 Validate database connection persistence across multiple API requests
