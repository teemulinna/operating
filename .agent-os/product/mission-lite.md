# Mission (Lite)

We're building the most intuitive resource planning platform for professional services teams, eliminating the chaos of spreadsheet-based planning.

Our centralized, visual solution helps team leads and project managers optimize workforce allocation by providing real-time over-allocation warnings, a weekly grid view for quick decision-making, and zero learning curve for spreadsheet users. We specifically target professional services teams (10-500 employees) who struggle with complex, error-prone spreadsheet planning that breaks down as teams scale beyond 25-30 members.
