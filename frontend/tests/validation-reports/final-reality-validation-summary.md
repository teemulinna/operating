  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe Updated",
  "email": "john.doe.updated@company.com",
  "position": "Senior Software Engineer",
  "departmentId": "e85e5cfe-1970-4ea8-98c8-4a59b7587a52", ← Foreign Key
  "departmentName": "Engineering",                      ← Computed Join
  "salary": "85000.00",                                ← Decimal Precision
  "hireDate": "2025-09-04T21:00:00.000Z",             ← ISO DateTime
  "skills": [],                                        ← JSON Array
  "isActive": true,                                    ← Boolean
  "createdAt": "2025-09-05T07:22:40.148Z",            ← Audit Timestamp
