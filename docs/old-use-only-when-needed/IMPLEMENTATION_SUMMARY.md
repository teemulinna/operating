## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Install ML dependencies
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node @tensorflow/tfjs
npm install --save-dev @types/tensorflow__tfjs-node

# 2. Create required directories
mkdir -p models migrations/ml migrations/tenant

# 3. Set up feature branches
git checkout -b feature/ml-pipeline
git checkout -b feature/multi-tenant
```

### Day 3-4: Database Preparation
```bash
# Run ML migrations
npm run migrate:up migrations/20250115_create_ml_tables.sql

# Create tenant template schema
npm run migrate:up migrations/20250120_create_tenant_tables.sql
```

### Day 5: Service Implementation Start
1. Implement MLDataCollectionService
2. Create unit tests for data collection
3. Set up TensorFlow.js environment

## 📊 Architecture Alignment Verification

### ✅ Aligns with Existing Architecture:
- Uses existing DatabaseService for all DB operations
- Extends current middleware patterns for tenant/RBAC
- Maintains TypeScript throughout
- Follows established service injection patterns
- Compatible with current Express.js routing

### ✅ Maintains Quality Standards:
- Type-safe implementations
- Comprehensive error handling
- >95% test coverage target
- Production-ready code (no mocks/simulations)

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation Actions

1. **ML Model Accuracy Risk**
   - Action: Collect more training data
   - Fallback: Use rule-based system initially

2. **Multi-tenant Performance Risk**
   - Action: Implement connection pooling per tenant
   - Fallback: Limit initial tenant count

3. **Security Vulnerability Risk**
   - Action: Conduct security audit week 7
   - Fallback: Delay production launch if issues found

## 📞 Communication Plan

- **Daily Standups**: Track progress against plan
- **Weekly Demo**: Show working features
- **Bi-weekly Stakeholder Update**: Business metrics review
- **Monthly Architecture Review**: Ensure alignment

## 🎉 Definition of Success

**Phase 3 (ML Pipeline)**:
- Working prediction API with >85% accuracy
- Automated training pipeline
- Real-time predictions in <200ms

**Phase 4 (Enterprise)**:
- Complete tenant isolation
- Working RBAC with <50ms permission checks
- Audit trail for compliance
