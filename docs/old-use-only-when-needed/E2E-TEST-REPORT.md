# E2E Test Report - Resource Management Platform
**Date:** September 25, 2025
**Testing Environment:** Frontend (localhost:3003) + Backend API (localhost:3001)

## Executive Summary

The application shows partial functionality with several critical issues. While basic navigation and data display work, key features like allocations are broken, and there's a disconnect between planned features and current implementation.

## Test Coverage vs. Project Plans

According to `docs/plan.md`, the system should include:
- ✅ Heat Maps (Phase 1) - **NOT VISIBLE IN UI**
- ✅ Advanced Availability Management (Phase 1) - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- ✅ What-If Scenarios (Phase 1) - **NOT VISIBLE IN UI**
- ✅ Intelligent Notifications & Insights - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- ✅ Time Intelligence & Tracking - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- ✅ Resource Engagement Requests - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- ✅ Financial Intelligence - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- ✅ Smart Skill Matching - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- ✅ Team Collaboration - **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

## Working Components

### ✅ Navigation & Routing
- All main navigation links work correctly
- Routes properly update URL and render appropriate components
- Active state correctly highlights current page

### ✅ Dashboard Page
- Loads successfully at root path `/`
- Displays basic metrics (25 employees, 4 projects, 0% utilization)
- Clean UI with no errors

### ✅ Employee Management
- Lists all employees with proper data
- Shows 25 total employees from backend
- Displays employee cards with:
  - Name, role, email, department
  - Weekly capacity and salary
  - Action buttons (View/Edit/Delete)
- Backend API returns real data successfully

### ✅ Project Management
- Lists 5 projects correctly
- Shows project details including:
  - Name, client, status, priority
  - Budget and progress percentages
  - Date ranges
  - Team member counts
- Properly displays overdue warnings
- Edit and delete buttons present

### ✅ Team Dashboard
- Shows comprehensive team member table
- Displays all 25 employees with:
  - Name, role, utilization (all at 0%)
  - Project assignments (all at 0)
  - Active status
- Summary statistics work

### ✅ Schedule View
- Weekly schedule grid loads
- Shows all employees with capacity
- Week navigation controls present
- No allocation data (expected - no allocations exist)

### ✅ Backend API
- All endpoints responding correctly:
  - `/api/employees` - Returns 25 employees
  - `/api/projects` - Returns 5 projects
  - `/api/departments` - Returns department data
  - Rate limiting handled gracefully

## Broken/Missing Components

### ❌ Allocation Management
- **Critical Error:** `ReferenceError: weekStart is not defined`
- Component crashes with error boundary
- Shows fallback error UI
- Core functionality completely broken

### ❌ Enhanced Schedule
- Navigation link exists but functionality unclear
- No differentiation from regular schedule visible

### ❌ Reports Page
- Link exists but functionality not tested
- No visible reporting features

### ❌ Planning Page
- Link exists but functionality not tested
- What-If scenarios not accessible

### ❌ Heat Map Features
- No heat map visualization found anywhere
- Phase 1 requirement not implemented in UI
- Backend endpoints exist but not utilized

### ❌ Availability Patterns
- No UI for availability management
- Cannot set patterns or exceptions
- Phase 1 requirement missing

### ❌ WebSocket Connection
- Multiple WebSocket errors in console
- Failed to connect on port 24678
- Real-time updates not functioning

### ❌ Data Integrity Issues
- Multiple duplicate "API Test" employees
- Test data mixed with production data
- No actual allocations despite projects being active

### ❌ E2E Test Suite
- Test files have errors (undefined methods)
- `projectPage.getTodayFormatted()` not defined
- Tests cannot run successfully

## Console Errors Detected

1. **WebSocket Connection Failed**
   - `WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:24678/?token=5KN4IhYkwZAp' failed`
   - Impacts real-time features

2. **Allocation Component Error**
   - `ReferenceError: weekStart is not defined`
   - Causes complete component failure

3. **React Router Warnings**
   - Future flag warnings about state updates
   - Relative route resolution warnings

## Performance Observations

- **Page Load Times:** Fast (~100ms)
- **API Response Times:** Good (handled with rate limiting)
- **Frontend Bundle:** Vite dev server performing well
- **Hot Module Replacement:** Working correctly

## Gap Analysis: Plan vs. Reality

| Feature | Planned (Phase 1) | Actual Status | Gap |
|---------|------------------|---------------|-----|
| Heat Maps | ✅ Complete views, endpoints, real-time | ❌ No UI visible | 100% |
| Availability Management | ✅ Patterns, exceptions, holidays | ❌ Not implemented | 100% |
| What-If Scenarios | ✅ Full analysis capabilities | ❌ Not accessible | 100% |
| Basic CRUD | ✅ Employees, Projects, Allocations | ⚠️ Allocations broken | 33% |
| Team Dashboard | ✅ Utilization views | ✅ Working but no data | 50% |
| WebSocket Events | ✅ Real-time updates | ❌ Connection fails | 100% |

## Critical Issues Priority

1. **P0 - Allocation Management Crash**
   - Blocks core functionality
   - JavaScript error prevents component loading

2. **P0 - WebSocket Connection Failure**
   - Blocks all real-time features
   - Server may not be running on expected port

3. **P1 - Missing Phase 1 Features**
   - Heat maps completely absent from UI
   - Availability management not implemented
   - What-If scenarios not accessible

4. **P2 - Data Quality**
   - Test data pollution
   - No actual allocation data
   - 0% utilization across all resources

5. **P2 - E2E Test Suite Broken**
   - Tests cannot run due to missing methods
   - Blocks automated testing

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix `weekStart is not defined` error in allocation component
2. Implement or expose heat map UI components
3. Start WebSocket server on port 24678
4. Clean up test data from production database

### Short-term (1 week)
1. Implement missing Phase 1 features per plan.md
2. Create actual allocation data for testing
3. Fix E2E test suite helper methods
4. Add availability management UI

### Medium-term (2-4 weeks)
1. Complete all Phase 1 requirements
2. Implement What-If scenario UI
3. Add real-time notification system
4. Create comprehensive test coverage

## Test Environment Details

- **Frontend:** Vite dev server on port 3003
- **Backend:** Express API on port 3001
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (connection working)
- **Node Version:** Not specified
- **Browser:** Playwright Chromium

## API Endpoint Analysis

### Working Backend Endpoints (Not Exposed in UI)
- `/api/capacity/heatmap` - Returns heat map data with color coding
- `/api/scenarios` - Returns empty array but endpoint works
- Other endpoints respond but many return 404

### Missing Backend Endpoints
- `/api/availability-patterns` - Returns 404 despite being Phase 1 requirement
- `/api/availability` - Listed but returns 404

## Conclusion

The application has a solid foundation with working employee and project management, but critical resource allocation features are broken, and most Phase 1 requirements from the planning document are not implemented in the UI. While some backend APIs exist (like heat maps), they are not connected to the frontend. The gap between documented plans and actual implementation is significant, suggesting either incomplete development or outdated documentation.

**Overall System Readiness: ~30%** - Basic CRUD partially works, but core resource management features are missing or broken. Backend has more functionality than frontend exposes.
